This project is a Telegram bot built using Python, Flask, and Dialogflow. The bot fetches and delivers news articles to users based on their queries or selected topics. It also supports small talk and custom intents defined in Dialogflow.

## Features

- Fetch news articles by category (e.g., World, Technology, Entertainment, etc.).
- Respond to user messages with small talk or other custom replies using Dialogflow.
- Interactive news topic selection with a keyboard interface.
- Handles text messages, commands, and stickers.
